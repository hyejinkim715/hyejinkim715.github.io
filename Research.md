## Research interests
I	 am	 a researcher	 and	 practitioner	 with keen	 interests	 in	 nature	 conservation,	 education and	 sustainable	
development.	I	 have	diverse expertise in	policy	 research,	 scenarios	and models,	 data	 visualization,	information	
communication	and	capacity	development at	multi-regional	scales.	I	have	an	interdisciplinary	training	background	
in	 social	 sciences,	 international	 governance,	 and	 biodiversity	 conservation. I	 have research	 experience	 in	
monitoring	the	implementation	of international	policies in	practice,	and promoting data-driven	policy	and	financial
planning.	I	have	coordination	experience in	organizational	reform,	capacity	building,	stakeholder	engagement	and	
institutional	 collaboration.	 I	 am	 passionate	 about	 fostering	 dialogue	 among scientists,	 policy	 makers and	 local	
practitioners	through co-developing	conceptual	models	and implementation	plans for	research	coordination	and	
decision support. I	really	enjoy	working	with	people	and	institutions. In	my	leisure,	I	travel with	my	dog	and	cat	
exploring serene	nature	and	learning how	science,	technology and	policies have	shaped human	history and	culture.
